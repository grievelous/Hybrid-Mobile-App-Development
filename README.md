<br>
<strong>This course is mainly focused on developing <br>
and deploying a mobile app version of the restaurant <br>
website called: <br> 
<u>conFusion!</u></strong>

## Week 1 and 2:

   * `different accesories of Ionic framework`
   * `Power and build up app`
   * `Modals, pop-overs, forms`
   * `Expand on iteractivity`
   * `Reproduce, simplify, results`

## Week 3 and 4:

   * `Simplifying Controller code with Resolve`
   * `Local storage`
   * `Android/iOS SDK and platforms + deployment of App`
   * `Splash screen for app`
   * `Notifyin the user`
   * `Camera-plugin`

### Command prompt: 

  `npm install ionic cordova -g` <br>
  `npm install bower -g` <br>
  `npm install grunt -g` <br>
  `npm install json-server`

### Start application:

  `json-server --watch db.json` <br>
  `ionic serve`
  
### Additional information:

  <strong>I seem to have alot of trouble to get the android emulator<br> to launch the application for reasons I couldn't understand in time to   fix them and also be on time with the course.<br>
  The Ionic app framework seems to also freeze with the comment modal, that is a known bug and the workaround to fix it<br>
  didn't work for me, sadly. I hope it works for you!<br></strong>
  [Here is a link for the freeze fix]( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40491717/ionic-app-freezes-or-stops-working-after-popover-and-modal-closes/40561429#40561429)<br>
  I got the certificate for this course and this is the final version of this course.<br>
  There will be no more updates in code on this project.
